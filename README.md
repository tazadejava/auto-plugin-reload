# AutoPluginReload

Developed for Minecraft development servers. This plugin will automatically load new plugins placed in the plugins folder into the server, and reload plugins when the file has been updated.

Uses code from PlugMan to unload and reload plugins.

# Usage

Simply download and place the jar file ([target/AutoPluginReload.jar](https://github.com/tazadejava/auto-plugin-reload/raw/master/target/AutoPluginReload.jar)) into the server's plugins folder. A config will be created to optionally broadcast to the entire server whenever a plugin is loaded or reloaded.
